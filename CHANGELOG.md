# Changelog

All notable changes to the Stride extension for Pi Coding Agent will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-08

### Removed

- **`skills/stride-workflow/SKILL.md`** — Removed all three references to the user-private `stride-development-guidelines` skill: the Step 5 ("Activate Development Guidelines") section, the corresponding flowchart node, and the Quick Reference Card line. That skill is project-local to the plugin author's machine and is not distributed with this plugin, so end users would have seen Step 5 instructing them to activate a skill that does not exist for them. The Step 5 slot is left empty rather than renumbered to avoid breaking step-number cross-references elsewhere in the file.

### Changed

- **`package.json`** — Bumped version from 0.1.0 to 0.2.0.

### Why this release

Cross-skill references to non-plugin skills break the workflow for end users. This guard rail is being applied to all five Stride plugins (`stride`, `stride-codex`, `stride-gemini`, `stride-opencode`, `stride-pi`) in a coordinated release.

## [0.1.0] - prior

Initial Pi Coding Agent edition (no CHANGELOG entries before 0.2.0).
