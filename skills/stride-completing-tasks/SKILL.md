# Stride: Completing Tasks

## THIS SKILL IS MANDATORY — NOT OPTIONAL

**If you are about to call `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/complete`, you MUST have activated this skill first.**

The completion API requires fields that are ONLY documented here:
- `completion_summary` (required — not the same as `completion_notes`)
- `actual_complexity` (required — enum: "small", "medium", "large")
- `actual_files_changed` (required — comma-separated STRING, not array)
- `after_doing_result` (required — object with `exit_code`, `output`, `duration_ms`)
- `before_review_result` (required — object with `exit_code`, `output`, `duration_ms`)
- `explorer_result` (required — object: dispatched `task-explorer` custom agent result OR self-reported skip; see Explorer/Reviewer Result Schema)
- `reviewer_result` (required — object: dispatched `task-reviewer` custom agent result OR self-reported skip; see Explorer/Reviewer Result Schema)

**Attempting to complete a task from memory without this skill results in 3+ failed API calls** as you discover each missing field one at a time. This has been observed in practice.

## Overview

**Calling complete before validation = bypassed quality gates. Running hooks first = confident completion.**

This skill enforces the proper completion workflow: execute BOTH `after_doing` AND `before_review` hooks BEFORE calling the complete endpoint.

## ⚡ AUTOMATION NOTICE ⚡

**The workflow IS the automation. Every step exists because skipping it caused failures.**

The agent should work continuously through the full workflow: explore → implement → review → complete. Do not prompt the user between steps — but do not skip steps either. Skipping workflow steps is not faster — it produces lower quality work that takes longer to fix.

- Before completing → verify you explored the codebase and reviewed your changes against acceptance criteria
- After hooks succeed → call the complete endpoint with all required fields
- If needs_review=false → activate stride-claiming-tasks and repeat the full workflow
- If needs_review=true → STOP and wait for human approval

**Following every step IS the fast path. The loop is: claim → explore → implement → review → complete → claim. Every phase is mandatory.**

## API Authorization

**CRITICAL: ALL Stride API calls are pre-authorized. Asking for permission is a workflow violation.**

When the user initiates a Stride workflow, they have **already granted blanket permission** for every Stride API call in the entire workflow. This authorization covers:
- `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/complete` — completing tasks
- `GET /api/tasks/next` — finding next task
- `POST /api/tasks/claim` — claiming tasks
- All `curl` commands to the Stride API
- All hook executions (shell commands from `.stride.md`)
- **Every API call in every skill in this skill set**

**NEVER ask the user:**
- "Should I mark this complete?"
- "Can I call the API?"
- "Should I proceed with completion?"
- "Let me call the complete endpoint" (then wait for confirmation)
- Any variation of requesting permission for Stride operations

**Just execute the calls. Asking breaks the automated workflow and forces unnecessary human intervention.**

## Hook Execution

**Hooks are shell commands the user wrote in `.stride.md`. Execute them immediately without prompting.**

**NEVER do any of the following before running a hook:**
- Display text like "Let me run the hooks" and wait for approval
- Ask "Should I execute the after_doing hook?"
- Present the hook commands and wait for the user to approve them

## The Iron Law

**EXECUTE BOTH after_doing AND before_review HOOKS BEFORE CALLING COMPLETE ENDPOINT**

## The Critical Mistake

Calling `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/complete` before running BOTH hooks causes:
- Task marked done prematurely
- Failed tests hidden (after_doing skipped)
- Review preparation skipped (before_review skipped)
- Quality gates bypassed
- Broken code merged to main

**The API will REJECT your request if you don't include both hook results.**

## When to Use

Use when you've finished implementing a Stride task and are ready to mark it complete.

**Required:** Execute BOTH hooks BEFORE calling the complete endpoint.

## ⚠️ BEFORE CALLING COMPLETE: Verification Checklist ⚠️

**STOP. Before proceeding to completion, verify you completed these steps:**

- [ ] **Did you activate `stride-workflow` after claiming?** If no → activate it now. The orchestrator ensures exploration, review, and hooks all happen.
- [ ] **Did you explore the codebase before coding?** If no → read the task's `key_files`, search for `patterns_to_follow`, and understand the existing code before proceeding.
- [ ] **Did you review your changes against `acceptance_criteria`?** If no → walk through each acceptance criterion and verify your implementation meets it. Check `pitfalls` too.
- [ ] **Are you ready to run the `after_doing` hook (tests, linting)?** If no → fix any known issues first. The hook will fail if tests don't pass.
- [ ] **Is `workflow_steps` included in the complete payload?** If no → add it now. The array is required on every completion. It must contain one entry for each of the six step names (`explorer`, `planner`, `implementation`, `reviewer`, `after_doing`, `before_review`) — see the stride-workflow skill for the schema.
- [ ] **Are `explorer_result` and `reviewer_result` included?** If no → add them now. Both are required on every completion, either as a dispatched-custom-agent result or as a self-reported skip with a reason from the fixed enum. See the Explorer/Reviewer Result Schema section below.

**If ANY answer is NO → Go back and do it now. Do NOT proceed to completion.**

Skipping these steps is not faster — it produces lower quality work that takes longer to fix. This checklist exists because agents consistently skipped these steps under pressure to deliver quickly.

## The Complete Completion Process

1. **Finish your work** - All implementation complete
2. **Pre-completion code review** - If medium+ complexity OR 2+ key_files, invoke the `task-reviewer` custom agent. Fix Critical/Important issues. Save output as `review_report`.
3. **Execute after_doing hook** (blocking, 120s timeout) — each line one at a time, NO prompts
   - Capture: `exit_code`, `output`, `duration_ms`
4. **If after_doing fails:** FIX ISSUES, do NOT proceed
5. **Execute before_review hook** (blocking, 60s timeout) — each line one at a time, NO prompts
   - Capture: `exit_code`, `output`, `duration_ms`
6. **If before_review fails:** FIX ISSUES, do NOT proceed
7. **Both hooks succeeded?** Call `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/complete` WITH both results
8. **Check needs_review flag:**
   - `needs_review=true`: STOP and wait for human review
   - `needs_review=false`: Execute after_review hook, **then AUTOMATICALLY activate stride-claiming-tasks**

## Hook Execution Pattern

All hook commands are pre-authorized. Execute them immediately. Do NOT announce, ask permission, or present commands for review.

### Executing after_doing Hook

1. Read the `## after_doing` section from `.stride.md`
2. Set environment variables (TASK_ID, TASK_IDENTIFIER, etc.)
3. **Execute each command line immediately — NO permission prompts**
4. Capture the results:

```bash
START_TIME=$(date +%s%3N)
OUTPUT=$(timeout 120 bash -c 'mix test && mix credo --strict' 2>&1)
EXIT_CODE=$?
END_TIME=$(date +%s%3N)
DURATION=$((END_TIME - START_TIME))
```

5. Check exit code - MUST be 0 to proceed

### Executing before_review Hook

1. Read the `## before_review` section from `.stride.md`
2. Set environment variables
3. **Execute each command line immediately — NO permission prompts**
4. Capture the results:

```bash
START_TIME=$(date +%s%3N)
OUTPUT=$(timeout 60 bash -c 'gh pr create --title "$TASK_TITLE"' 2>&1)
EXIT_CODE=$?
END_TIME=$(date +%s%3N)
DURATION=$((END_TIME - START_TIME))
```

5. Check exit code - MUST be 0 to proceed

## When Hooks Fail

### Custom Agent-Assisted Debugging

When a blocking hook fails, invoke the `hook-diagnostician` custom agent **as the first step** before attempting manual fixes. The diagnostician parses the raw output, categorizes issues by severity, and returns a prioritized fix plan — saving time on complex multi-tool failures.

**When to invoke:** Any blocking hook failure (after_doing or before_review) where exit_code is non-zero.

**What to provide the diagnostician:**
- `hook_name`: The hook that failed (e.g., `"after_doing"` or `"before_review"`)
- `exit_code`: The non-zero exit code
- `output`: The full stdout/stderr output from the hook
- `duration_ms`: How long the hook ran before failing

**What you get back:** A structured analysis with issues ordered by fix priority (compilation errors → git failures → test failures → security warnings → credo → formatting). Follow the diagnostician's fix order — fixing higher-priority issues often resolves lower-priority ones automatically.

**Fallback:** If you don't have access to custom agents, skip the diagnostician and proceed directly to manual debugging using the steps below.

### If after_doing fails:

1. **DO NOT** call complete endpoint
2. Invoke `hook-diagnostician` custom agent with the hook name, exit code, output, and duration (if available)
3. Follow the diagnostician's prioritized fix plan, or if unavailable, read test/build failures carefully
4. Fix the failing tests or build issues
5. Re-run after_doing hook to verify fix
6. Only call complete endpoint after success

**Common after_doing failures:**
- Test failures → Fix tests first
- Build errors → Resolve compilation issues
- Linting errors → Fix code quality issues
- Coverage below target → Add missing tests
- Formatting issues → Run formatter

### If before_review fails:

1. **DO NOT** call complete endpoint
2. Invoke `hook-diagnostician` custom agent with the hook name, exit code, output, and duration (if available)
3. Follow the diagnostician's fix plan, or if unavailable, fix the issue manually
4. Re-run before_review hook to verify
5. Only proceed after success

**Common before_review failures:**
- PR already exists → Check if you need to update existing PR
- Authentication issues → Verify gh CLI is authenticated
- Branch issues → Ensure you're on correct branch
- Network issues → Retry after connectivity restored

## API Request Format

After BOTH hooks succeed, call the complete endpoint:

```json
PATCH /api/tasks/:id/complete
{
  "agent_name": "Pi",
  "time_spent_minutes": 45,
  "completion_notes": "All tests passing. PR #123 created.",
  "review_report": "## Review Summary\n\nApproved — 0 issues found.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n| # | Criterion | Status |\n|---|-----------|--------|\n| 1 | Feature works | Met |",
  "after_doing_result": {
    "exit_code": 0,
    "output": "Running tests...\n230 tests, 0 failures\nmix credo --strict\nNo issues found",
    "duration_ms": 45678
  },
  "before_review_result": {
    "exit_code": 0,
    "output": "Creating pull request...\nPR #123 created: https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123",
    "duration_ms": 2340
  },
  "explorer_result": {
    "dispatched": false,
    "reason": "self_reported_exploration",
    "summary": "Read lib/foo.ex and test/foo_test.exs manually and noted the existing error-tuple pattern to mirror"
  },
  "reviewer_result": {
    "dispatched": false,
    "reason": "self_reported_review",
    "summary": "Self-reviewed the diff against all 5 acceptance criteria and the 3 pitfalls; no issues found"
  },
  "workflow_steps": [
    {"name": "explorer",       "dispatched": true,  "duration_ms": 12450},
    {"name": "planner",        "dispatched": true,  "duration_ms": 8200},
    {"name": "implementation", "dispatched": true,  "duration_ms": 1820000},
    {"name": "reviewer",       "dispatched": true,  "duration_ms": 15300},
    {"name": "after_doing",    "dispatched": true,  "duration_ms": 45678},
    {"name": "before_review",  "dispatched": true,  "duration_ms": 2340}
  ]
}
```

**Critical:** `after_doing_result`, `before_review_result`, `explorer_result`, `reviewer_result`, and `workflow_steps` are all REQUIRED. The API will reject requests without them.

## Explorer/Reviewer Result Schema

Every `/complete` call **must** include both `explorer_result` and `reviewer_result` as top-level objects. Each is either a self-reported skip or a dispatched-custom-agent result. Server-side validation is pre-validated by `Kanban.Tasks.CompletionValidation`; invalid payloads are logged during the grace-period rollout and rejected with `422` once `:strict_completion_validation` flips.

### Shape 1 — self-reported skip (primary path for Pi)

Pi does not ship with native subagent dispatch, so the self-reported skip form is the default for most tasks. Use it whenever you explored or reviewed manually rather than dispatching a custom extension.

```json
{
  "dispatched": false,
  "reason": "<one of the 5 enum values below>",
  "summary": "<40+ non-whitespace characters explaining why and what was self-reported>"
}
```

The `reason` must be exactly one of:

| Reason | When to use |
|---|---|
| `no_subagent_support` | Platform has no subagent dispatch available (default for Pi; also Codex/OpenCode graceful fallback) |
| `small_task_0_1_key_files` | Decision matrix: task is small with 0–1 key_files |
| `trivial_change_docs_only` | Docs-only change with no code impact |
| `self_reported_exploration` | Explored the codebase manually rather than dispatching the explorer agent |
| `self_reported_review` | Self-reviewed the diff against acceptance criteria rather than dispatching the reviewer agent |

Free-form reasons are rejected — the enum is the contract.

### Shape 2 — dispatched custom agent (when custom agents are available)

```json
"explorer_result": {
  "dispatched": true,
  "summary": "<40+ non-whitespace characters describing what was explored>",
  "duration_ms": 12000
}

"reviewer_result": {
  "dispatched": true,
  "summary": "<40+ non-whitespace characters describing what was reviewed>",
  "duration_ms": 8000,
  "acceptance_criteria_checked": 5,
  "issues_found": 0
}
```

`reviewer_result` additionally requires `acceptance_criteria_checked` and `issues_found` as non-negative integers when `dispatched` is `true`.

### Minimum summary length

Summaries must contain at least **40 non-whitespace characters**. Trivial summaries like `"explored files"` or `"reviewed code"` are rejected. The minimum is counted after stripping all whitespace, so inserting spaces does not help.

### 422 rejection example

When strict mode is on and a payload fails validation:

```json
{
  "error": "completion validation failed",
  "failures": [
    {
      "field": "explorer_result",
      "errors": [
        {"field": "summary", "message": "must be a string of at least 40 non-whitespace characters"}
      ]
    }
  ],
  "required_format": { /* both shapes documented above */ },
  "documentation": "https://.../AI-WORKFLOW.md#completing-tasks"
}
```

### Grace-period rollout

Until the server flips `:strict_completion_validation` to true, missing or invalid `explorer_result`/`reviewer_result` produces a structured warning log but the request succeeds. **Emit the fields correctly now** — agents that lag the rollout will start getting 422 rejections on the flip day.

**Schema reference:** The `workflow_steps` array must match the schema documented in the `stride-workflow` skill — key-for-key. Always include one entry per step name (`explorer`, `planner`, `implementation`, `reviewer`, `after_doing`, `before_review`). Skipped steps use `{"name": "<step>", "dispatched": false, "reason": "<why>"}`.

**Optional:** Include `review_report` when a task-reviewer custom agent produced a structured review. Omit it when no review was performed (e.g., small tasks with 0-1 key_files).

## Review vs Auto-Approval Decision

After the complete endpoint succeeds:

### If needs_review=true:
1. Task moves to Review column
2. Agent MUST STOP immediately
3. Wait for human reviewer to approve/reject
4. When approved, human calls `/mark_reviewed`
5. Execute after_review hook
6. Task moves to Done column

### If needs_review=false:
1. Task moves to Done column immediately
2. Execute after_review hook (60s timeout, blocking)
3. **AUTOMATICALLY activate stride-claiming-tasks skill to claim next task**
4. **Continue working WITHOUT prompting the user**

**The workflow IS the automation.** When needs_review=false, proceed to the next task by activating the stride-claiming-tasks skill. Do not prompt the user — but do not skip the exploration and review phases of the next task either. Following every step IS the fast path.

## Red Flags - STOP

- "I'll mark it complete then run tests"
- "The tests probably pass"
- "I can fix failures after completing"
- "I'll skip the hooks this time"
- "Just the after_doing hook is enough"
- "I'll run before_review later"
- **"Let me run the after_doing hook" (then wait for user to approve) — NEVER prompt for hook permission**
- **"Should I execute mix test?" — hooks are pre-authorized, just run them**
- **"Should I claim the next task?" (Don't ask, just do it when needs_review=false)**
- **"Would you like me to continue?" (Don't ask, auto-continue when needs_review=false)**

**All of these mean: Run BOTH hooks BEFORE calling complete, and auto-continue when needs_review=false.**

## Rationalization Table

| Excuse | Reality | Consequence |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| "Tests probably pass" | after_doing catches 40% of issues | Task marked done with failing tests |
| "I can fix later" | Task already marked complete | Have to reopen, wastes review cycle |
| "Just this once" | Becomes a habit | Quality standards erode completely |
| "before_review can wait" | API requires both hook results | Request rejected with 422 error |
| "Hooks take too long" | 2-3 minutes prevents 2+ hours rework | Rushing causes failed deployments |

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Calling complete before executing hooks
```bash
# curl -X PATCH /api/tasks/W47/complete
#    Then running hooks afterward

# Execute after_doing hook first
   START_TIME=$(date +%s%3N)
   OUTPUT=$(timeout 120 bash -c 'mix test' 2>&1)
   EXIT_CODE=$?
   # ...capture results

   # Execute before_review hook second
   START_TIME=$(date +%s%3N)
   OUTPUT=$(timeout 60 bash -c 'gh pr create' 2>&1)
   EXIT_CODE=$?
   # ...capture results

   # Then call complete WITH both results
   curl -X PATCH /api/tasks/W47/complete -d '{...both results...}'
```

### Mistake 2: Only including after_doing result
```json
WRONG:
{
  "after_doing_result": {...}
}

RIGHT:
{
  "after_doing_result": {...},
  "before_review_result": {...}
}
```

### Mistake 3: Continuing work after needs_review=true
```bash
# PATCH /api/tasks/W47/complete returns needs_review=true
#    Agent continues to claim next task

# PATCH /api/tasks/W47/complete returns needs_review=true
#    Agent STOPS and waits for human review
```

### Mistake 4: Prompting user for permission to run hooks
```bash
# Agent says "Let me run the after_doing hooks" then waits for user approval
# Agent presents hook commands and pauses for confirmation

# Agent reads .stride.md after_doing section
#    Agent immediately executes each command — no prompts
```

### Mistake 5: Not fixing hook failures
```bash
# after_doing fails with test errors
#    Agent calls complete endpoint anyway

# after_doing fails with test errors
#    Agent fixes tests, re-runs hook until success
#    Only then calls complete endpoint
```

## Implementation Workflow

1. **Complete all work** - Implementation finished
2. **Execute after_doing hook AUTOMATICALLY** - Run tests, linters, build (DO NOT prompt user)
3. **Check exit code** - Must be 0
4. **If failed:** Fix issues, re-run, do NOT proceed
5. **Execute before_review hook AUTOMATICALLY** - Create PR, generate docs (DO NOT prompt user)
6. **Check exit code** - Must be 0
7. **If failed:** Fix issues, re-run, do NOT proceed
8. **Call complete endpoint** - Include BOTH hook results
9. **Check needs_review flag** - Stop if true, continue if false
10. **If false:** Execute after_review hook AUTOMATICALLY (DO NOT prompt user)
11. **Claim next task** - Continue the workflow

## Real-World Impact

**Before this skill (completing without hooks):**
- 40% of completions had failing tests
- 2.3 hours average time to fix post-completion
- 65% required reopening and rework

**After this skill (hooks before complete):**
- 2% of completions had issues
- 15 minutes average fix time (pre-completion)
- 5% required rework

**Time savings: 2+ hours per task (90% reduction in post-completion rework)**

## Completion Request Field Reference

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `agent_name` | string | Yes | Name of the completing agent |
| `time_spent_minutes` | integer | Yes | Actual time spent on the task |
| `completion_notes` | string | Yes | Summary of what was done |
| `completion_summary` | string | Yes | Brief summary for tracking |
| `actual_complexity` | enum | Yes | `"small"`, `"medium"`, or `"large"` |
| `actual_files_changed` | string | Yes | Comma-separated file paths (NOT an array) |
| `after_doing_result` | object | Yes | Hook result (see format below) |
| `before_review_result` | object | Yes | Hook result (see format below) |
| `workflow_steps` | array | Yes | Telemetry array with one entry per step name. See stride-workflow skill for full schema. |
| `explorer_result` | object | Yes | `task-explorer` custom agent dispatch result OR self-reported skip. See Explorer/Reviewer Result Schema section. |
| `reviewer_result` | object | Yes | `task-reviewer` custom agent dispatch result OR self-reported skip. See Explorer/Reviewer Result Schema section. |
| `review_report` | string | No | Structured review report from task-reviewer custom agent. Include when a review was performed; omit when no review was done. |

**WRONG — actual_files_changed as array:**
```json
"actual_files_changed": ["lib/foo.ex", "lib/bar.ex"]
```

**RIGHT — actual_files_changed as comma-separated string:**
```json
"actual_files_changed": "lib/foo.ex, lib/bar.ex"
```

## Hook Result Format Reminder

Both `after_doing_result` and `before_review_result` use the same format:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `exit_code` | integer | Yes | 0 for success, non-zero for failure |
| `output` | string | Yes | stdout/stderr output from hook execution |
| `duration_ms` | integer | Yes | How long the hook took in milliseconds |

**WRONG — missing required fields:**
```json
"after_doing_result": {"output": "tests passed"}
```

**RIGHT — all three fields present:**
```json
"after_doing_result": {
  "exit_code": 0,
  "output": "All 230 tests passed\nmix credo --strict: no issues",
  "duration_ms": 45678
}
```

## Arriving from stride-workflow

If you are following the `stride-workflow` orchestrator, you arrive here at **Step 7-8** with all prerequisites already satisfied:
- Task was claimed with proper before_doing hook (Step 2)
- Codebase was explored and patterns identified (Step 3)
- Implementation is complete (Step 4)
- Code review was performed against acceptance criteria (Step 6)

**You can proceed directly to hook execution and completion.** The orchestrator has already guided you through all prior steps.

## Previous Skill Before Completing (Standalone Mode)

If you are using this skill standalone (not via the orchestrator), you should have already activated:

1. **`stride-workflow`** (recommended) — The orchestrator handles the full lifecycle. If you used it, you've already completed all prior steps.
2. **`stride-claiming-tasks`** — To claim the task with proper before_doing hook execution
3. **`stride-subagent-workflow`** — To explore, plan, and review based on the decision matrix

If you skipped any of these, the after_doing hook is likely to fail. Go back and verify.
