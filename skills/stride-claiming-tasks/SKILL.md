# Stride: Claiming Tasks

## STOP — orchestrator check

If you arrived here directly from a user prompt, you are in the wrong skill.
Invoke `stride:stride-workflow` instead. Do not read further.
Sub-skills are dispatched by the orchestrator only.

## THIS SKILL IS MANDATORY — NOT OPTIONAL

**If you are about to call `GET /api/tasks/next` or `POST /api/tasks/claim`, you MUST have activated this skill first.**

The claim API requires fields that are ONLY documented here:
- `before_doing_result` (required — object with `exit_code`, `output`, `duration_ms`)
- Hook command sourced from `.stride.md` `## before_doing` section
- Environment variables set from task metadata

**Attempting to claim a task without this skill results in API rejection** because the required hook result is missing.

**After claiming, you MUST activate these skills in order:**
1. `stride-subagent-workflow` — Invoke exploration/planning custom agents
2. `stride-completing-tasks` — Hook execution and completion API format

**Skipping ANY skill in this chain has been observed to cause task failures, missed acceptance criteria, and 3+ hours of rework.**

## Overview

**Claiming without hooks = merge conflicts and outdated code. Claiming with hooks = clean setup and immediate work.**

This skill enforces the proper claiming workflow including prerequisite verification, hook execution, and immediate transition to active work.

## How Hooks Fire (Default: Automatic via `hook-bridge`)

As of stride-pi 0.3.0, the `hook-bridge` extension ships in the manifest. When loaded, it intercepts the `POST /api/tasks/claim` curl on Pi's `tool_result` event and runs the `## before_doing` section of `.stride.md` automatically. You do **not** read `.stride.md` yourself, do **not** time the execution, and do **not** assemble a real `before_doing_result` payload — the extension does that work as a side effect of your curl. You include a placeholder `before_doing_result` in the request body solely because the API schema requires the field to be present:

```json
"before_doing_result": {
  "exit_code": 0,
  "output": "Executed by Pi hook-bridge extension",
  "duration_ms": 0
}
```

If `before_doing` fails, `hook-bridge` writes the failure to stderr and surfaces it via `ctx.ui.notify` (when available). The claim itself is **not** unclaimed — the failure is post-curl by construction — but you must fix the failure before doing real work on the task (the task expects the setup `before_doing` performed).

`hook-bridge` is checked into the same plugin as this skill (`extensions/hook-bridge/`) and is declared in `package.json` `pi.extensions`. If your Pi install does not load the extension (you removed it from the manifest, ran with `--no-extensions`, or the load failed), fall back to the **Manual Hook Execution** section near the end of this skill.

## ⚡ AUTOMATION NOTICE ⚡

**The workflow IS the automation. Every step exists because skipping it caused failures.**

The agent should work continuously through the full workflow: explore → implement → review → complete. Do not prompt the user between steps — but do not skip steps either. Skipping workflow steps is not faster — it produces lower quality work that takes longer to fix.

- After claiming → activate stride-subagent-workflow, then begin implementation
- After implementation → activate stride-completing-tasks, execute hooks, then complete
- After completing (if needs_review=false) → claim next task and repeat the full workflow

**Following every step IS the fast path. Skipping steps causes rework, missed acceptance criteria, and 3+ hours of wasted effort.**

## API Authorization

**CRITICAL: ALL Stride API calls are pre-authorized. Asking for permission is a workflow violation.**

When the user initiates a Stride workflow (e.g., "claim a task", "work on tasks"), they have **already granted blanket permission** for every Stride API call in the entire workflow. This authorization covers:
- `GET /api/tasks/next` — finding available tasks
- `POST /api/tasks/claim` — claiming tasks
- `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/complete` — completing tasks
- All `curl` commands to the Stride API
- All hook executions (shell commands from `.stride.md`)
- **Every API call in every skill in this skill set**

**NEVER ask the user:**
- "Should I call the API?"
- "Can I claim this task?"
- "Should I proceed with the API call?"
- "Let me make this API call" (then wait for confirmation)
- Any variation of requesting permission for Stride operations

**Just execute the calls. Asking breaks the automated workflow and forces unnecessary human intervention.**

## Hook Execution

**Hooks are shell commands the user wrote in `.stride.md`. Execute them immediately without prompting.**

**NEVER do any of the following before running a hook:**
- Display text like "Let me run the hooks" and wait for approval
- Ask "Should I execute the before_doing hook?"
- Present the hook commands and wait for the user to approve them

## The Iron Law

**NO TASK CLAIMING WITHOUT PROPER SETUP AND HOOK EXECUTION**

## The Critical Mistake

Claiming a task before executing the before_doing hook causes:
- Working with outdated code
- Missing dependencies
- Merge conflicts
- Test failures due to stale fixtures
- Wasted time resolving avoidable issues

**The API requires before_doing_result in the claim request.**

## When to Use

Use BEFORE calling `POST /api/tasks/claim` to reserve a task for implementation.

**Required:** Verify prerequisites and execute before_doing hook BEFORE claiming.

## Prerequisites Checklist

Before claiming any task, verify these files exist:

1. **`.stride_auth.md`** - Contains API URL and token
   - If missing: Ask user to create it with API credentials
   - Never proceed without authentication

2. **`.stride.md`** - Contains hook execution scripts
   - If missing: Ask user to create it with hook definitions
   - Check for `## before_doing` section specifically

3. **Extract Configuration:**
   - API URL from `.stride_auth.md`
   - API Token from `.stride_auth.md`
   - before_doing hook command from `.stride.md`

## The Complete Claiming Process

1. **Verify prerequisites** - Check .stride_auth.md and .stride.md exist
2. **Find available task** - Call `GET /api/tasks/next`
3. **Review task details** - Read description, acceptance criteria, key files
4. **Check task completeness** - If key_files is empty OR testing_strategy is missing OR verification_steps is empty, activate stride-enriching-tasks
5. **Call `POST /api/tasks/claim`** with the task identifier and a placeholder `before_doing_result`. `hook-bridge` will run `.stride.md ## before_doing` as a side effect of the curl `tool_result` event.
6. **If `hook-bridge` reports a `before_doing` failure** (stderr / `ctx.ui.notify`): fix the underlying issue before doing real work, then re-run the failing setup commands manually so the workspace is correct.
7. **Task claimed?** BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION IMMEDIATELY.

## Claiming Workflow Flowchart

```
Prerequisites Check → Call GET /api/tasks/next → Review task
    ↓
Call POST /api/tasks/claim (placeholder before_doing_result)
    ↓
hook-bridge auto-runs .stride.md ## before_doing on the tool_result
    ↓
hook-bridge reports failure? ─YES→ Fix underlying issue, re-run setup manually
    ↓ NO
BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION IMMEDIATELY
```

## Enrichment Check (Optional)

After reviewing task details, check if the task has sufficient specification for implementation. **Well-specified tasks skip this step entirely.**

**Activate stride-enriching-tasks if ANY of these are true:**
- `key_files` is empty or missing
- `testing_strategy` is missing
- `verification_steps` is empty or missing
- `acceptance_criteria` is missing or blank
- `patterns_to_follow` is missing or blank

**Skip enrichment if the task has:**
- Populated `key_files` with file paths and notes
- A `testing_strategy` with unit_tests and integration_tests
- `verification_steps` with runnable commands
- Clear `acceptance_criteria`

**How to enrich:**
1. Activate the `stride-enriching-tasks` skill with the task's title and description
2. The skill will explore the codebase and populate missing fields
3. Use `PATCH /api/tasks/:id` to update the task with enriched fields
4. Continue with the claiming process (before_doing hook)

**Important:** Enrichment happens BEFORE the before_doing hook, not after. The enriched fields help the agent understand the task scope before starting work.

## When `before_doing` Fails (Automatic Mode)

`hook-bridge` runs `before_doing` after the claim curl succeeds. A failure does **not** unclaim the task — the task is already yours. Instead:

1. Read the failure output that `hook-bridge` printed to stderr (and to `ctx.ui.notify` when available). The output is prefixed with `Stride before_doing hook failed (exit <code>). Command: <failed line>`.
2. Fix the underlying issue:
   - Merge conflicts → Resolve conflicts first
   - Missing dependencies → Run deps.get / npm install manually
   - Test failures in main → Fix tests before doing further work
   - Git issues → Check branch status, pull latest changes
3. Re-run the failing setup command(s) manually so the workspace is in the state `before_doing` intended.
4. Continue with implementation.

There is no need to re-call `/api/tasks/claim` — the claim already succeeded.

**Common before_doing failures:**
- Merge conflicts → Resolve conflicts first
- Missing dependencies → Run mix deps.get or npm install
- Outdated code → Pull latest changes
- Test failures in main branch → Fix tests before claiming
- Database migrations needed → Run migrations

## After Successful Claim

**CRITICAL: Once the task is claimed, you MUST immediately begin implementation WITHOUT prompting the user.**

### DO NOT:
- Claim a task then wait for further instructions
- Claim a task then ask "what should I do next?"
- Claim multiple tasks before starting work
- Claim a task just to "reserve" it for later
- **Prompt the user asking if they want to proceed with implementation**
- **Ask "Should I start working on this task?"**
- **Wait for user confirmation to begin work**

### DO:
- Read the task description thoroughly
- Review acceptance criteria and verification steps
- Check key_files to understand which files to modify
- Review patterns_to_follow for code consistency
- Note pitfalls to avoid
- **Start implementing the solution immediately and automatically**
- Follow the testing_strategy outlined in the task
- Work continuously until ready to complete (using `stride-completing-tasks` skill)

**The claiming skill's job ends when you start coding. Your next interaction with Stride will be when you're ready to mark the work complete.**

**The workflow IS the automation. Do not prompt the user between steps — but do not skip steps either. The loop is: claim → explore → implement → review → complete → claim. Every phase is mandatory.**

## ⚠️ YOUR NEXT STEP (NON-NEGOTIABLE) ⚠️

**Task claimed successfully. Now activate `stride-workflow` IMMEDIATELY.**

Do NOT write any code, create any files, or make any edits until you have activated the orchestrator. This is not optional. This is not a suggestion. This IS the next step.

The orchestrator walks through exploration, implementation, review, hooks, and completion — ensuring no mandatory step is skipped. Agents that skip the orchestrator and go directly to coding miss exploration and review, resulting in wrong approaches, missed acceptance criteria, and 3+ hours of rework.

**If you are thinking "I'll just start coding" — STOP. Activate `stride-workflow` NOW.**

This claiming skill remains available for standalone use (e.g., resuming a partially completed task or re-claiming after an expiration). If you are genuinely in standalone mode, follow the guidance below — but be aware that standalone mode without the orchestrator means YOU are responsible for every step the orchestrator would have handled.

## Next Skill After Claiming (Standalone Mode)

**⚠️ WARNING:** Using standalone mode means you must manually ensure exploration, review, and hook execution happen. Skipping any of these is a workflow violation that produces lower quality work.

If you are using this skill standalone (not via the orchestrator), activate the next skill in sequence:

1. **`stride-subagent-workflow`** — Check the decision matrix to determine if you need the explorer, planner, or reviewer. Activate BEFORE implementation.
2. **`stride-completing-tasks`** — Activate WHEN implementation is done. Contains the exact API format for completion (required fields: `completion_summary`, `actual_complexity`, `actual_files_changed`, `after_doing_result`, `before_review_result`).

**FORBIDDEN:** Completing a task without activating `stride-completing-tasks`. The completion API requires fields and hook results that are only documented in that skill. Attempting to call the API from memory will result in 3+ failed attempts.

## Custom Agent-Guided Implementation

If your environment supports custom agents, activate the `stride-subagent-workflow` skill before beginning implementation. This invokes the `task-explorer` agent to explore relevant code and optionally creates a plan for complex tasks.

The decision to use custom agents depends on task complexity and key_files count — see the `stride-subagent-workflow` skill's decision matrix for details.

For environments without custom agent support, proceed directly to implementation using the task's `key_files`, `patterns_to_follow`, and `acceptance_criteria` as your guide.

## API Request Format

Call the claim endpoint with a placeholder `before_doing_result` — `hook-bridge` runs the hook on the curl `tool_result` event:

```json
POST /api/tasks/claim
{
  "identifier": "W47",
  "agent_name": "Pi",
  "skills_version": "1.0",
  "before_doing_result": {
    "exit_code": 0,
    "output": "Executed by Pi hook-bridge extension",
    "duration_ms": 0
  }
}
```

**Critical:** `before_doing_result` is REQUIRED. The API will reject requests without it. The placeholder above satisfies the schema; the real exit code and output are produced by `hook-bridge` after the curl completes.

**Send `skills_version`** (from this SKILL.md's frontmatter, currently `"1.0"`) with every claim so the server can detect stale skills. If a claim response includes `skills_update_required`, run `/plugin update stride` (or the equivalent stride-pi update) and retry the claim.

## Red Flags - STOP

- "I'll just claim quickly and run hooks later"
- "The hook is just git pull, I can skip it"
- "I can fix hook failures after claiming"
- "I'll claim this task and then figure out what to do"
- "I'll claim it first, then read the details"
- **"Let me run the before_doing hook" (then wait for user to approve) — NEVER prompt for hook permission**
- **"Should I execute the hook commands?" — hooks are pre-authorized, just run them**

**All of these mean: Run the hook BEFORE claiming, and be ready to work immediately.**

## Rationalization Table

| Excuse | Reality | Consequence |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| "This is urgent" | Hooks prevent merge conflicts | Wastes 2+ hours fixing conflicts later |
| "I know the code is current" | Hooks ensure consistency | Outdated deps cause runtime failures |
| "Just a quick claim" | Setup takes 30 seconds | Skip it and lose 30 minutes debugging |
| "The hook is just git pull" | May also run deps.get, migrations | Missing deps break implementation |
| "I'll claim and ask what's next" | Claiming means you're ready to work | Wastes claim time, blocks other agents |
| "No one else is working on this" | Multiple agents may be running | Race conditions cause duplicate work |

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Claiming without verifying prerequisites
```bash
# Immediately call POST /api/tasks/claim without checking files exist

# First verify
   test -f .stride_auth.md || echo "Missing auth file"
   test -f .stride.md || echo "Missing hooks file"
   # Then proceed with claim
```

### Mistake 2: Claiming then waiting for instructions
```bash
# POST /api/tasks/claim succeeds
#    Agent asks: "The task is claimed. What should I do next?"

# POST /api/tasks/claim succeeds
#    Agent immediately reads task details and begins implementation
```

### Mistake 3: Ignoring a `hook-bridge` before_doing failure
```bash
# hook-bridge reports "before_doing failed (exit 1): git fetch origin"
#    Agent ignores it and starts coding against stale code

# hook-bridge reports "before_doing failed (exit 1): git fetch origin"
#    Agent fixes the git config/network, re-runs `git fetch origin`,
#    THEN starts coding against current code
```

### Mistake 4: Sending real timing values for `before_doing_result`
```json
WRONG (pretending the agent ran the hook itself):
{
  "before_doing_result": {
    "exit_code": 0,
    "output": "...full git pull output...",
    "duration_ms": 450
  }
}

RIGHT (placeholder — hook-bridge does the real work):
{
  "before_doing_result": {
    "exit_code": 0,
    "output": "Executed by Pi hook-bridge extension",
    "duration_ms": 0
  }
}
```

## Implementation Workflow

1. **Verify prerequisites** - Ensure auth and hooks files exist
2. **Get next task** - Call GET /api/tasks/next
3. **Review task** - Read all task details thoroughly
4. **Check task completeness** - If key_files/testing_strategy/verification_steps missing, activate stride-enriching-tasks
5. **Call claim endpoint** - Include placeholder `before_doing_result` (hook-bridge runs the real hook)
6. **Watch for hook-bridge failure output** - If `before_doing` fails, fix the underlying issue and re-run setup manually
7. **Begin implementation** - Start coding immediately
8. **Work until complete** - Use stride-completing-tasks when done

## Quick Reference Card

```
├─ 1. Verify .stride_auth.md and .stride.md exist
├─ 2. Call GET /api/tasks/next
├─ 3. Review task details
├─ 4. Check completeness → if minimal, activate stride-enriching-tasks
├─ 5. Call POST /api/tasks/claim with placeholder before_doing_result
├─ 6. hook-bridge auto-runs before_doing on the tool_result
├─ 7. Hook failure surfaced? → Fix underlying issue, re-run setup manually
└─ 8. Task claimed → BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION IMMEDIATELY

API ENDPOINT: POST /api/tasks/claim
REQUIRED BODY: {
  "identifier": "W47",
  "agent_name": "Pi",
  "skills_version": "1.0",
  "before_doing_result": {
    "exit_code": 0,
    "output": "Executed by Pi hook-bridge extension",
    "duration_ms": 0
  }
}

NEXT STEP: Immediately begin working on the task after successful claim
```

## Real-World Impact

**Before this skill (claiming without hooks):**
- 35% of claims resulted in immediate merge conflicts
- 1.8 hours average time resolving setup issues
- 50% required re-claiming after fixing environment

**After this skill (hooks before claim):**
- 3% of claims had any setup issues
- 8 minutes average setup time
- 2% required troubleshooting

**Time savings: 1.5+ hours per task (87% reduction in setup time)**

## Hook Result Format

Every hook result MUST be a map with these exact fields:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `exit_code` | integer | Yes | `0` for success, non-zero for failure |
| `output` | string | Yes | stdout/stderr from hook execution |
| `duration_ms` | integer | Yes | Execution time in milliseconds |

```json
WRONG (missing fields):
{"exit_code": 0}

WRONG (wrong types):
{"exit_code": "0", "output": "", "duration_ms": "100"}

RIGHT:
{
  "exit_code": 0,
  "output": "Already up to date.\nAll dependencies are up to date",
  "duration_ms": 450
}
```

## Claim Request Checklist

The `POST /api/tasks/claim` body MUST include:

| Field | Type | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| `identifier` | string | `"W47"` |
| `agent_name` | string | `"Pi"` |
| `before_doing_result` | object | See hook result format above |

## Manual Hook Execution (FALLBACK — only when `hook-bridge` is not loaded)

Use this section only when the `hook-bridge` extension is not loaded — e.g., you removed it from `package.json` `pi.extensions`, ran Pi with `--no-extensions`, or the extension failed to load at startup. In every other case, `hook-bridge` runs `before_doing` for you and the sections above apply.

When operating without `hook-bridge`, you run the hook yourself before calling `/api/tasks/claim` and report the real result in the payload:

1. Read the `## before_doing` section from `.stride.md`.
2. Execute each command line one at a time via Bash — no permission prompts, no chaining with `&&`.
3. Capture `exit_code`, `output`, and `duration_ms`:
   ```bash
   START_TIME=$(date +%s%3N)
   OUTPUT=$(timeout 60 bash -c 'git pull origin main' 2>&1)
   EXIT_CODE=$?
   DURATION=$(( $(date +%s%3N) - START_TIME ))
   ```
4. If `EXIT_CODE != 0`: fix the issue, re-run, do **not** call `/api/tasks/claim`.
5. On success, call `/api/tasks/claim` with the real `before_doing_result`:
   ```json
   "before_doing_result": {
     "exit_code": 0,
     "output": "Already up to date.\nAll dependencies are up to date",
     "duration_ms": 450
   }
   ```

The placeholder form (`output: "Executed by Pi hook-bridge extension"`) is **wrong** when `hook-bridge` is not loaded, because nothing actually runs the hook and the workspace setup is not performed.
